## Why does a fridge magnet stick?

You press a magnet to the fridge and it holds. You flip it around and... it still holds. But try sticking it to a wooden door and nothing happens. What's going on?

That simple question — *why does this stick here but not there?* — is the doorway into one of the most fascinating forces in the universe. Let's walk through it together.

## What You'll Learn

- What a magnet actually is (and what it isn't)
- Why every magnet has two poles — and what happens when they meet
- The difference between attraction and repulsion
- Why magnets stick to some things but not others (a first look)

## What Is a Magnet?

A magnet is any object that produces an invisible force that can push or pull certain materials — most notably <Element id="Fe">iron</Element> and steel — without touching them.

That "without touching" part is key. Most forces in everyday life require contact: you push a door, you pull a drawer. But magnets act through empty space, through paper, through your hand. This invisible reach is what makes magnetism feel almost magical.

<Callout type="info">
Magnets don't run on batteries or electricity (at least not the permanent magnets on your fridge). The force comes from the arrangement of atoms inside the magnet itself. We'll dig into *why* in Module 3.

## Every Magnet Has Two Poles

Pick up any magnet and it has two ends that behave differently. We call them the **north pole** and the **south pole**.

Here's the fundamental rule:

- **Opposite poles attract.** North pulls toward south. South pulls toward north.
- **Like poles repel.** North pushes away from north. South pushes away from south.

This is true for every magnet ever found — from a tiny fridge magnet to the Earth itself.

### See It in Action

Don't just take our word for it — try it yourself. Drag the two magnets below toward each other and watch what happens. Then hit **Flip** to reverse one magnet's poles and try again.

<MagnetPoles />

<Callout type="tip">
Think of it like this: opposites attract, and likes repel. This pattern shows up again and again in physics — it's one of the first "rules of the game" worth remembering.
</Callout>

### You Can't Have Just One Pole

Here's something surprising: if you break a magnet in half, you don't get a north piece and a south piece. You get *two smaller magnets*, each with its own north and south pole.

No matter how many times you break it, every piece is a complete magnet with both poles. Scientists have never found an isolated magnetic pole (a "magnetic monopole") — it's one of the deep mysteries of physics.

<img src="/images/modules/01/breaking-magnet.png" alt="Diagram showing a magnet being cut in half with scissors — each half becomes a complete magnet with both north and south poles" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '400px', margin: '1.5rem auto', display: 'block', borderRadius: '0.75rem'}} />

<CommonMisconception
  myth="If you cut a magnet in half, you get a separate north pole and south pole."
  reality="Each half becomes a complete magnet with both a north and a south pole. You can never isolate a single pole."
/>

## Attraction and Repulsion

When you bring two magnets close together, you can feel the force between them before they even touch.

**Attraction** feels like a gentle tug pulling the magnets together. It gets stronger the closer they get, until — *snap* — they lock together.

**Repulsion** feels like pushing against an invisible cushion. The closer you try to force like poles together, the harder the magnet pushes back. It's a strange sensation because there's nothing visible between them.

<img src="/images/modules/01/attract-repel.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison: opposite poles attracting with field lines connecting, and like poles repelling with field lines pushing apart" style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '520px', margin: '1.5rem auto', display: 'block', borderRadius: '0.75rem'}} />

<CommonMisconception
  myth="Magnets only attract things. Repulsion is rare or unusual."
  reality="Attraction and repulsion are equally fundamental. Every magnet both attracts and repels — it depends on which poles are facing each other."
/>

## Why Some Things Stick (and Others Don't)

Your fridge magnet sticks to the fridge (steel) but not to a wooden cutting board, a glass cup, or your hand. Why?

The short answer: only certain materials respond strongly to magnets. The most common is **iron** (and things made from iron, like steel). <Element id="Ni">Nickel</Element> and <Element id="Co">cobalt</Element> also respond. Most other everyday materials — wood, plastic, glass, <Element id="Al">aluminum</Element>, <Element id="Cu">copper</Element> — don't noticeably respond.

The *why* behind this is one of the most interesting stories in magnetism, and it has to do with what's happening at the atomic level inside these materials. We'll get there in Module 3.

<Callout type="info">
A quick note on steel: steel is mostly iron, which is why magnets stick to it. Stainless steel is trickier — some types are magnetic and some aren't, depending on the exact mix of metals.

## Try It Yourself

<TryIt>

**What you'll need:** Two magnets (fridge magnets, or any magnets you have around).

1. Hold one magnet in each hand and slowly bring them together. Feel the pull when opposite poles face each other.
2. Now flip one magnet around and bring them together again. Feel the push of repulsion.
3. Try to force like poles together. Notice how the force gets stronger the closer they get.
4. Walk around your home and test what sticks: fridge, door handle, aluminum can, coins, keys, scissors.

**What to notice:** The push of repulsion is just as real as the pull of attraction. And the strength changes dramatically with distance — even a small gap makes a big difference.

## Going Deeper: Why Mixing Metals Changes Everything

You might have noticed something odd if you've ever tested a magnet around your kitchen: the fridge door? Magnetic. The stainless steel sink? Not magnetic. But they're both "steel." What's going on?

The answer is **alloys** — metals made by mixing two or more elements together. Pure iron is strongly magnetic. But when you mix in enough of certain other metals, you can disrupt the internal structure that makes iron respond to magnets.

**Regular steel** is mostly iron with a small amount of <Element id="C">carbon</Element>. The iron still dominates, so it behaves magnetically — your fridge door, car body, and steel nails all stick to magnets.

**Stainless steel** adds <Element id="Cr">chromium</Element> (for rust resistance) and often nickel. Some grades — like the "18/10" stainless used in cookware — contain so much nickel that the metal's internal structure shifts into a form that doesn't respond to magnets at all. Other grades, like those used in knife blades, remain magnetic.

This is a clue about something deeper: magnetism isn't just about *what atoms are present* — it's about *how they're arranged*. The same iron atoms can be magnetic or non-magnetic depending on the structure around them. We'll explore exactly why in Module 3.

<Callout type="tip">
Here's a kitchen experiment: test a magnet on different stainless steel items — pots, pans, cutlery, your sink. You'll likely find a mix of magnetic and non-magnetic pieces. The difference comes down to the alloy recipe.
</Callout>

## Summary

- A **magnet** produces an invisible force that can attract or repel without touching.
- Every magnet has a **north pole** and a **south pole** — you can never have one without the other.
- **Opposite poles attract**; **like poles repel**.
- Only certain materials (mainly iron, nickel, cobalt) respond strongly to magnets.
- The force between magnets gets much stronger as they get closer.

## What's Next

We've seen that magnets create an invisible push and pull that reaches through empty space. But how far does it reach? Is it the same everywhere around the magnet, or does it have a shape?

In the next module, we'll make this invisible force *visible* by introducing one of the most powerful ideas in physics: the <Term id="field">**field**</Term>.
