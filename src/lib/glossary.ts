  // Module 1
  "north pole":
    "One of the two ends of a magnet. It points toward Earth's geographic north when the magnet hangs freely. Opposite poles attract; like poles repel.",
  "south pole":
    "One of the two ends of a magnet. It points toward Earth's geographic south when the magnet hangs freely. Opposite poles attract; like poles repel.",
  alloy:
    "A metal made by mixing two or more elements together. Alloys can have very different magnetic properties than their ingredients.",

  // Module 2
  field:
    "An invisible landscape of influence around a magnet — a map of the magnetic force at every point in space.",
  "field lines":
    "Curved lines that map a magnetic field's direction and strength. Dense lines mean a stronger field; spread-out lines mean weaker.",
  "neutral point":
    "A spot where magnetic fields from two sources cancel each other out, resulting in zero net field.",
  superposition:
    "When two or more magnetic fields overlap, they add together — reinforcing where they point the same way and cancelling where they oppose.",
  "inverse-square law":
    "The pattern where a field's strength drops to one-quarter when you double the distance from the source. It's pure geometry — spreading over an ever-larger area.",

  // Module 3
  spin: "A built-in property of electrons that makes each one act like a tiny magnet. Despite the name, nothing is physically rotating.",
  "unpaired electron":
    "An electron without a partner to cancel its magnetic pull, giving the atom a net magnetic contribution.",
  "magnetic moment":
    "A measure of how strong a tiny magnet an atom (or electron) is — the bigger the moment, the stronger the pull.",
  "magnetic domain":
    "A microscopic region inside a magnetic material where billions of atomic magnets are all aligned in the same direction.",
  "exchange interaction":
    "A quantum mechanical effect where neighboring atoms influence each other's magnetic alignment — the key ingredient that makes iron, cobalt, and nickel ferromagnetic.",
  "domain wall":
    "The boundary between two magnetic domains where atomic magnets gradually rotate from one domain's direction to the other's.",
  ferromagnetic:
    "A material whose atoms cooperate magnetically, forming domains that produce strong attraction to magnets. Only iron, cobalt, and nickel are ferromagnetic at room temperature.",
  paramagnetic:
    "A material with unpaired electrons but no neighbor cooperation — weakly and temporarily attracted to magnets, invisible without lab instruments.",
  diamagnetic:
    "A material that is very slightly repelled by magnets. All materials are diamagnetic, but the effect is usually overwhelmed by stronger magnetic behaviors.",
  "Curie temperature":
    "The temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses its neighbor cooperation and becomes paramagnetic.",
